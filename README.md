## Blackjack Project - Week 4 Skill Distillery

###Overview

This is the Blackjack Application. It uses several classes of cards and players all being called through the main app. A dealer shuffles the deck and deals the initial hand. The dealer's first card is hidden and not revealed until after the player has made the choices to hit or stay. Several checks are made throughout the application to see if the player or dealer have hit a blackjack, or busted. 

### Technologies Used

*GitHub
*Java
*Eclipse

### Lessons Learned
My knowledge of lists, abstract classes, and loops were put to the test in this project. Understanding when I had to make lists and when to call them from other classes was something that I initially lacked. This caused several infinite loops or null pointer exceptions. However, thanks to those experiences, my overall understanding and level of comfortability have grown.
